# Petful Adoption Site
Petful is an online pet adoption service that connects people to different shelters with pets up for adoption. We use a first-in-first-out system, so pets that have been there longest get adopted first.

## How it works
Each shelter's adoption process is different. Here's an example of how a shelter adoption might work:

1. You find a pet you want to adopt on Petful. We use a first-in-first-out system, and so you'll only be able to adopt the pets we've had the longest.

2. You click Adopt and fill in your name.

3. You go to the shelter, pay the adoption fee(usually $25 to $125), and then take your new pet home.
